# wTorrent

Simple torrent download service based on [Dropwizard](http://wwww.dropwizard.io)

## Use

This is a very simple sideproject that I started with the intention of learning Java and Dropwizard. At the moment uses 
[jlibtorrentv 1.2.0.0-beta5](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-jlibtorrent) which is NOT included and should be built using the instructions in their site.
